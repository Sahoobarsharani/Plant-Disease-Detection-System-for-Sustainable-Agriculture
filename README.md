# Plant-Disease-Detection-System-for-Sustainable-Agriculture
The Plant Disease Detection System leverages advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect diseases in plants from leaf images. This project aims to promote sustainable agriculture by providing farmers with a fast, reliable, and cost-effective method to identify plant diseases and take timely action to mitigate crop loss.
# Usage

Upload an image of the plant leaf through the application interface.

The system processes the image and provides a diagnosis of the plant's health.

Recommendations for treatment are displayed if a disease is detected.
